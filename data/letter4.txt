 DEAR ELAINE,

 ALIENS ELAINE, ALIENS!!!
THERE WERE ALIENS IN THOSE
RUINS! I MANAGED TO ESCAPE
BUT NOW THEY ARE LOOKING FOR
ME, SO, I CANNOT STOP HERE!
I AM MAILING YOU ALL THE
LETTERS I WROTE, SO YOU HAVE
A RECORD.

 I THINK ALIENS HAVE BEEN
TINKERING WITH OUR HISTORY.
I NEED TO FIND OUT WHY, SO I
AM MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR 
MY NEXT EXPEDITION, TO MARS!

I WILL SEE YOU BACK IN A
FEW MONTHS!

 WHISH ME LUCK!
 MICHAEL S. XAVIER
