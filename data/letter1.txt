 JUNE 27TH, 1983
 DEAR ELAINE, 

 WHEN YOU READ THIS LETTER, I
WILL FIND MYSELF DEEP INTO THE
YUCATAN JUNGLE. I AM SORRY I
DID NOT WRITE YOU EARLIER. BUT
THIS EXPEDITION IS PERHAPS THE
MOST IMPORTANT EXPEDITION OF
MY ENTIRE LIFE.
 COMPARING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE
RUINS EXPLORED BY STEVENS AND
CATHERWOOD IN 1941 WITH RECENT
REPORTS DOES NOT ADD UP. I
HAVE SUSPECTED FOR A WHILE 
THAT SOMETHING WAS FOUND THAT
HAD TO BE KEPT SECRET. YOU
MIGHT THINK IT'S A HUNCH, BUT
I THINK I AM ON TO SOMETHING!

 WHISH ME LUCK,
 MICHAEL S. XAVIER
