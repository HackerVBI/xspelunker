 DEAR ELAINE,

 I HAVE BEEN EXPLORING THESE
RUINS FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THERE
IS MORE HERE THAN I THOUGHT!

 I FOUND MY WAY TO THE DEEPER
RUINS AND THERE IS ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGY DOWN HERE! THE
MAYAS WERE NOT WHO HISTORY
WANTS US TO BELIEVE! BUT I AM 
NOT ALONE. THEY KNOW I AM 
HERE. SO I DO NOT HAVE MORE 
TIME TO WRITE...

I NEED TO FIND MY WAY OUT OF 
HERE NOW!

 MICHAEL S. XAVIER
