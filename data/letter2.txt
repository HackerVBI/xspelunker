 DEAR ELAINE, 

 IF THIS LETTER REACHES YOU
BEFORE ME, I PROBABLY DID NOT
MAKE IT OUT ALIVE...

 I WAS RIGHT! I HAVE FOUND THE
ENTRANCE TO THE RUINS! STEVENS
HAD DESCRIBED THIS ENTRANCE IN
HIS ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT, WHICH
WAS EDITED LATER ON. I NEED
TO FIND OUT WHY...

 YOU SHOULD SEE THIS, THESE
RUINS ARE MAGNIFICENT!

 MICHAEL S. XAVIER
